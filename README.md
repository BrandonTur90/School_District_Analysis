# School_District_Analysis


## Overview

The purpose of this project was to analyze and organize data on 15 different schools. Statistics such
as average reading and math grades, budget data, cost per student, school type, and more were run through
using Pandas, and put into easy to read charts. After an initial analysis, it was found that one of the 
schools had a cheating problem, and another analysis was done to account for this change. I have included
the original summaries for both the school district as a whole, as well as the schools themselves.
