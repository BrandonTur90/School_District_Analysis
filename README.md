# School_District_Analysis


##Overview

The prupose of this project was to analyze and organize data on 15 different schools. Statistics such
as average reading and math grades, budget data, cost per student, school type, and more were run through
using Pandas, and put into easy to read charts. After an initial analysis, it was found that one of the 
schools had a cheating problem, and another analysis was done to account for this change. For completion's
sake, I will include charts from both to show how this affected the outcome.
